Nashville, TN: Acklen Avenue Software announced today that Stephanie Johnson, former COO of Zycron and most recently EVP of Customer Experience at Stratasan, and Manuel Calderon, former SVP of the U.S. Business Unit at Overactive, have joined Acklen Avenue as executive team members. These two key hires represent the ambition that Acklen Avenue has to support and multiply the expansive growth it has experienced in the last two years. 

Reporting directly to CEO and cofounder Colin Callahan, Stephanie will bring her long track record of success in fast-growing technology companies to the role. She also serves on the Board of the Nashville Technology Council. Her focus will be on implementing the structures and metrics needed to scale the organization. 

“Acklen Avenue is at an incredibly exciting point in its history: positioned for growth with a very strong foundation in its process and value proposition. As I got to know the team and learned the company story, it became clear that this was the right place and time for me to bring my expertise and leadership to continue to strengthen operations and prepare us for continued growth.”  

Manuel brings 20 years of experience in business and technology, most recently leading and helping taking Overactive from 350 employees and contractors to over 700, doubling client base and revenue. His joining signifies the increasing opportunity Acklen Avenue sees for its staff augmentation business, called HeroUnit. 

“Great culture, great people, great partnerships, great services is what the market demands, and Acklen Avenue embodies all of these. I’m honored to join the Acklen team, and bring my experience and leadership to continue the company's growth and expansion.”

“Stephanie and Manuel joining our executive team represents an invigorating moment in Acklen Avenue history,” says Colin Callahan. “These two stellar professionals are key in scaling to meet the growth we have already seen, and fueling and sustaining substantial growth. Plus they each play something like five musical instruments, so they’re going to fit right in!”
