A few years ago, we went through an arduous process of defining who we are and why we do what we do. To some this might appear unnecessary, but when our truest goal is to build relationships from where custom software is then built, we needed to come clean on what defines us and what influences our decisions and leads us to where we want to go. By doing so, we would be able to draw in not only the best talent we could find, but also, those who believe what we believe and to create the unimaginable.

So, back then, we defined ourselves as a company that will: 
 - Rigorously pursue fun.  
 - Empower our teammates. 
 - Own our client’s success. 
 - Demand elegant solutions. 
 - Create community.

This quickly became known as our core values, they empowered us tremendously. Today, and because we got to set that first stone, we have learned that we could accomplish more. We could be more. In some ways, we already are more. 

We have grown by leaps and bounds taking new challenges and initiatives. We outgrew fun, empowerment, success, elegance and community and we found ourselves revisiting what defines us.

So, what defines Acklen Avenue today? 

**Integrity** 

We will do the right thing, even if it hurts, by not participating or supporting dishonesty, corruption, or unfairness to any people group. We will do what’s best for our clients, even if it means losing money or saying goodbye. We will be honest in everything we do.

**Mastery**

We will be better than we were yesterday by finding ways to improve each day and welcoming better ways to do things. We will empower our teammates to do better, facilitating learning for those inside and outside our organization. We will welcome feedback from all angles and always demand elegant solutions.

**Quality**

We will create high-quality products, inside and out by taking ownership of our client's success.
We will spend the time it takes to do a great job in order to help our clients get what they really need, not just what they said they needed 6 months ago. We will deliver a product that makes our client happy and be worthy of repeat business.

**Agility**

We will deliver valuable, flexible and maintainable products as often as possible by partnering with our clients in order to maximize learning and product value by using an Agile Approach to software development. We will allow down to speed up.

**Love**

We will care for our fellow ackleners, both professionally and personally at the same time we care for our clients and their success.

The essence of our old core values resides in each of our new ones, a reminder of how much we have grown, how much growth remains and how we will all get there.
