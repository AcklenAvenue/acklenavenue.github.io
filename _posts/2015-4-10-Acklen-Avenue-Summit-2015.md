Next week Acklen Avenue is hosting it’s annual Summit. We’ve hosted several summits in the past 2 years in locations like Lago de Yojoa and Santa Ana. This year we’re coming back to charming Santa Ana, because we can’t get enough! Santa Ana is a city located 30 minutes south of Honduras capital Tegucigalpa. Most of the team members are joining, including some of our main office in Nashville, Tennessee for a week packed of fun activities.

This summit promises to be the best yet. What a better way to kick off a summit than to have a team building activity? The first day (Tuesday) we get to watch a soccer game and catch up with fellow team members. After that we start with our first training session, which can we will proudly broadcast for the entire tech community. For a complete list of the training sessions planned for this year’s summit you can check our [google plus site](https://plus.google.com/+Acklenavenue). Wednesday is made up of more training sessions and other fun activities. Things get really exciting during the next 2 days. In thursday we have a small barcamp during the evening and after dinner we get to show off our skills in a videogame night. 

Lastly, we are closing the summit on friday with an all day hackathon where our talented team members get to play with hubot and typescript in the hopes of building an awesome hack to improve any process in the company or just build something really cool that helps the whole tech community. 

Here is a trailer of the upcoming summit.
