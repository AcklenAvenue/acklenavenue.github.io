				Acklen Avenue was founded in Nashville, TN in 2010 by two .NET developers focused on building an agile software development company committed to delivering clean, maintainable code to customers, following the highest ethical and technical standards.
<br/>
<br/>
				Colin Callahan, Co-Founder and CEO, was fascinated by technology and fell naturally into programming after taking C++ and database classes. Byron Sommerdahl, Co-Founder, had been developing software since he was 9 years old, coding RPG's on his Commodore 64 and his best friend's Apple IIe. The two set out to form a company that would focus on delivering value for customers while developing talent and giving their employees a place to thrive.

				Through a serendipitous mission trip to Honduras and a resulting love story, Acklen was introduced to a new pool of skilled talent that also created opportunities for people in a struggling economy. Hiring developers in Honduras proved financially beneficial and allowed Acklen Avenue to keep valuable team members on the bench between contracts.

				Establishing a high-performing team structure of developers that stayed together over time proved to be a competitive advantage and has been the flagship offering of Acklen Avenue over the past 12 years. Additional opportunities and referrals led Acklen to broaden its offering to include Staff Augmentation.

				By utilizing its best-in-class talent recruitment and vetting process, Acklen can place individual engineers with organizations that donâ€™t require a complete development team. The combination of offerings allows Acklen Avenue to be flexible while remaining true to its core values. Acklen employs nearly 200 team members in over 21 countries all while maintaining a people first approach.
