    <p>
      Buffalo Royalties is an oil and gas investment and management company. They have a diverse mineral property portfolio across the 48 contiguous states. They have years of experience in leasing, selling, and buying mineral properties, as well as marketing
      properties to other companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the acquisition of new mineral rights and properties, an economic evaluation process is essential.  This evaluation process normally takes days per opportunity. Other software in the market is expensive and extremely complex, requiring advanced training
      in order to do the most basic calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buffalo Royalties approached Acklen Avenue to develop their vision: a simple, easy-to-use web application which would let users generate the necessary calculations  without needing to know advanced mathematics - <a href="http://www.drillnomics.com/"><strong>Drillnomics</strong></a>

    <h3 class="text-left">Solution:</h3>
    <p>
      Acklen Avenue built a system that was intuitive, easy to use, and could efficiently manage data from various data sources. Users now upload data from existing datasets and add their own domain knowledge to quickly and easily evaluate new opportunities.
      Data can be quickly and easily modified and the resulting change in ROI is easily shown instantly through charts, graphs, and PDF reports.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, the processing time needed to evaluate a new opportunity has been cut. What once took days now only takes a few hours. What once required a highly-trained expert in oil property economics now can be accomplished by anyone with a comparatively
      small amount domain knowledge.
