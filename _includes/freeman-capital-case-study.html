			<h3>About Freeman Capital</h3>
			<p class="text-block" >
				Freeman Capital was founded with the mission to create generational wealth within underserved communities, especially among people of color, and ultimately closing the wealth gap. 
				It does this by providing highly customized financial advisory services to individuals who may have historically had less access to personalized insights and counsel. Leveraging technology to improve access to excellent financial advice and insight, Freeman Capital forges a consistent relationship with their clients to help them meet their financial goals.

	<h2>The Challenge</h2>
	<p class="text-block--centered">
		When Freeman Capital’s CEO Calvin Williams, Jr., approached Acklen Avenue through a referral, the company needed to build a unified digital solution that supported the thriving existing business.

	<h2>The Approach</h2>
	<p class="text-block--two-columns" >
		We helped the TAFS team develop a mobile app which interfaced with their clients and also their internal tools; it created a workflow that is highly efficient and stable which carries the invoice detail directly from their clients, including all backup documentation and deposits that data and content into their invoice processing system.
		It also shares pertinent information with their task tracking tool by creating a new card for each invoice batch that is completed by the client and tags a TAFS team member so they know it’s ready to process.

			<h2>The Evolution</h2>
			<p>Acklen helped visualize the user flow of the app by building a design strategy for the app which has been continually referred to as the app was being developed. Since we created the app for both IOS and Android, there were challenges in making the app work on both platforms which inherently have a different set of tools available for our team.
			</p>
			<p>The camera functionality was especially challenging on IOS but over the course of a few sprints we were able to find a solution that worked with the app. There have been a few roadblocks with 3rd party applications that were integrated with the app but we have overcome all of them so far and now have a very stable app that is helping clients receive funds faster and a much easier process for the TAFS team. </p>
