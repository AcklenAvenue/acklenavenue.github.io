		When we build custom software we see craft, not code. Whether Acklen solves a complex problem, creates a custom web application or builds a cross-platform mobile application, the work is strong, durable and beautiful. Like an Amish table, our software is art meant to be used.

		<br>
		Shoddy construction will crumble software like it does furniture or buildings. As a shop of master craftsmen, Acklen adheres to Agile software development principles, including domain-driven design, test-driven development, SOLID and sprints. The process delivers functioning project pieces every two to three weeks. Without technical debt, our software is extensible so adding features or making changes is a short process that does not mean starting from scratch. Again.
