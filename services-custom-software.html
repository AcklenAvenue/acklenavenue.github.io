		<p>Our Custom Software Development Principles:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>	
			<b>Project Planning with Agile Requirements</b> - <i>you need software in months not years.</i> We start quickly by creating placeholders, known as User Stories, for the features of your system and prioritizing them by value and risk. We only add the details for each piece of software when we know that it will be developed in the next iteration which is only 2 weeks away. This helps us to get started quickly and not waste time on the details of features that might not be developed.
			</li>
			<li>
			<b>Clear Acceptance Criteria</b> - <i>you need to know that we are building what you want us to build.</i> We work with you to create acceptance criteria that let’s us know when the feature is done. This keeps the team on track and ensures that you get what you want. 
			</li>
			<li>
			<b>Clean Code</b> - <i>you need to be able to add new features without slowing down.</i> If your code is a mess things are hard to find and you can’t add new features with confidence. When your code is clean and robust, it is very easy to locate bugs and add new features. In fact, it’s a pleasure. We are clean code experts.
			</li>
			<li>
			<b>Working Features Every Two Weeks</b> - <i>you need to know that things are getting done. What better way than to see it working.</i> After each demo we get feedback and make changes based on what you tell us. Every two weeks we get visibly closer to having your project completed. 
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		All of these things add to your ability to plan for the future. When things are well built, it is easy to maintain. When things are easy to maintain, it is easy to predict when new features will be ready. We take the coding, management and deployment of the project off your plate so you can focus on your customers.
