	Acklen Avenue’s CTO lives part of the year in Honduras, where he has recruited the smartest and most tenacious developers and trained them in core Agile practices. Honduras, which is in the same time zone as Nashville, has Central America’s largest per-capita population of English speakers. The culture and Acklen’s training combine in amazing developers who we treat as family. 

	For companies that need additional hands but want to avoid offshore developers, near-shore staff augmentation can be the perfect solution. We entrust our stars with select clients, often after Agile coaching gets them on a path that produces results.
